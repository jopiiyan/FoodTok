# FoodTok

[![CI](https://github.com/jopiiyan/FoodTok/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jopiiyan/FoodTok/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

> A TikTok-style Android app for infinite-scroll recipe discovery, built for SUTD 50.001 Information Systems & Programming (Spring 2026).

FoodTok lets home cooks swipe through short cooking videos, filter recipes by ingredients on hand, chat with an AI about any dish, and receive personalized recommendations based on their taste and allergens.

## Overview

FoodTok is a vertical-video recipe discovery app modeled after the short-form video feeds users already know. It is delivered as a native Android client backed by Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage) and Google Gemini for AI-driven features. Every recipe carries structured ingredient metadata, enabling ingredient-on-hand search, allergen filtering, and a recommendation engine that adapts to user behavior in real time.

The project was scoped to demonstrate strong object-oriented design, custom data structures from SUTD 50.004, and a production-shaped service architecture suitable for extension into a real product.

---

## Feature Set

### Authentication & Onboarding
- Email/password sign-up and login via **Supabase GoTrue** with JWT session persistence.
- **Transparent JWT refresh** on 401 via an OkHttp `Authenticator`, so the UI never sees an expired token.
- Post-signup **3-step onboarding flow** (avatar, cuisine preferences, allergen blacklist) that seeds the user's recommendation profile on first launch.

### Feed & Discovery
- **TikTok-style nested ViewPager2** — vertical swipe between recipes, horizontal swipe between Ingredients / For You / Chat panes.
- **ExoPlayer-based video playback** with a pooled player architecture (`FeedVideoPlayerPool`) and `VideoCache` for smooth autoplay and low jank.
- **Grid feed** alternative view for browse-style discovery.
- **Saved-recipes feed** pulling from the user's `interactions` table.
- **Interaction buttons** (like, save, not-interested, comment) that write through to Postgres and feed back into the recommendation model.

### Recommendation Engine
- Custom **max-heap priority queue** (`RecipePriorityQueue`) for O(log n) ranking of candidate recipes.
- **HashMap-backed interest profile** on `User` — tags are scored on +30 (preference), +5 (like), +10 (save), –10 (not-interested), with inverse deltas on undo.
- **Allergen/blacklist penalty** applied before ranking so flagged recipes are demoted or excluded.
- Feed re-ranks after every interaction, giving the user an immediately noticeable personalization signal.

### Ingredient Search
- **Custom Trie** (`data/Trie.java`, `data/TrieNode.java`) with O(L) autocomplete over the full ingredient catalog.
- **Chip-based multi-ingredient query** in `SearchFragment`, ranked server-side-adjacent by match count.
- **User search** with a dedicated adapter for discovering other creators.

### Recipe Upload
- Camera or gallery video picker, followed by a structured upload form with ingredient chips, prep/cook time pickers, and tag selection.
- Uploads go to **Supabase Storage**, and the recipe row is created atomically via PostgREST.

### Comments
- Bottom-sheet comments UI with real-time-style refresh on submit.
- Pagination-ready ordering via PostgREST.

### AI Features (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- **Per-recipe chatbot** with conversation memory (20-message cap per recipe) and a context-aware system prompt that injects title, ingredients (with allergen flags), times, and tags.
- **On-demand recipe enrichment** ("Generate AI Insights" button) that returns allergens, generated instructions, calorie estimates, and suggested tags in a single JSON response.
- **Client-side enrichment cache** keyed by `recipeId` to avoid repeat quota spend.
- **Graceful 429 handling** with user-facing messaging and mock fallback if no API key is configured.

### Profile & Social
- Manage profile (avatar, username, preferences, allergens).
- Follow / unfollow other users with follower/following list views.
- View other users' profiles and their recipe grids.

### UX Polish
- Haptic feedback on primary interactions.
- Dark scrim gradient and safe-area handling for feed overlays.
- Keyboard-aware layout so the bottom nav isn't pushed off-screen.
- Consistent color tokens in `colors.xml` (no hardcoded hex in layouts).

            └─── ExoPlayer ◄─── HLS/MP4 (direct Storage URL)
```

The app is fully serverless on the backend — Supabase handles auth, Postgres with auto-generated REST, and object storage. Gemini is currently called from the device with a debug key, and will move behind an Edge Function for production (see [Next Steps](#next-steps)).

### Service Architecture

Every external capability is expressed as an **interface + real impl + mock impl + provider factory**, enabling offline development and deterministic unit tests:

```
IRecipeService ──► SupabaseRecipeService   (prod)
                └─ MockRecipeService       (tests / offline)

IChatService  ──► GeminiChatService
                └─ MockChatService

IAuthService  ──► SupabaseAuthService
                └─ MockAuthService

...and so on for comments, interactions, enrichment.
```

Providers auto-select the real implementation when credentials are present and fall back to the mock otherwise — the rest of the app is unaware.

## Data Structures & Algorithms

The SUTD 50.004 requirement mandates custom implementations — Java's built-in collections may back custom structures but cannot be the whole answer.

| Structure | Location | Purpose | Complexity |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Trie** | `data/Trie.java` | Ingredient autocomplete as the user types. | O(L) per lookup |
| **Max-Heap Priority Queue** | `data/RecipePriorityQueue.java` | Feed ranking against the interest profile. | O(log n) insert, O(1) peek |
| **HashMap Interest Profile** | `User.interestProfile` | Tag → score map updated on every interaction. | O(1) get/put |
| **HashSet-backed Allergen Check** | `Recipe.findBlacklistedIngredients()` | Reject flagged recipes before ranking. | O(1) per ingredient |

All custom structures ship with JUnit coverage (`TrieTest`, `RecipePriorityQueueTest`, `RecommendationServiceTest`).

---

## OOP Design

The codebase deliberately applies the principles graded by the course:

- **Encapsulation** — private fields, intentional getters/setters, `Collections.unmodifiableList()` on exposed collections, fully-immutable `Ingredient` and `ChatMessage`.
- **Tell, Don't Ask** — e.g. `Recipe.containsAllergen(user)` rather than exposing ingredients for callers to iterate.
- **Strategy Pattern** — every service is an interface with real + mock strategies selected by a provider at runtime.
- **Singleton / Factory** — `AuthManager`, `SessionManager`, `*ServiceProvider` factories.
- **Adapter Pattern** — RecyclerView adapters with view-type polymorphism (chat bubbles, grid vs. feed cells).
- **Observer / Callback** — async boundary expressed via typed callback interfaces (`AuthCallback`, `ChatCallback`, etc.).
- **Separation of Concerns** — fragments do not contain business logic; services have no Android View references; adapters only bind.

Code adheres to the **Google Java Style Guide** (2-space indent, 100-char lines, K&R braces, full brace usage, class-level Javadoc on public types).

## Database Schema

The app uses Supabase (Postgres + PostgREST + Auth + Storage). Supabase Auth owns accounts in `auth.users`; `profiles` extends them with app data.

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `profiles` | App-side user data: username, avatar, `interest_profile` (JSONB), `blacklisted_ingredients` (TEXT[]). |
| `recipes` | Recipe metadata: title, description, video URL, tags, prep/cook times, estimated calories. |
| `ingredients` | Canonical ingredient catalog with allergen flags and calorie density. |
| `recipe_ingredients` | M:N join with `quantity` and `is_optional`. |
| `interactions` | Like / save / not_interested / view events (unique per user × recipe × type). |
| `comments` | Per-recipe comments. |
| `cookbooks` / `cookbook_recipes` | User-curated recipe collections. |
| `follows` | Follower graph with proper FK constraints. |

Row-Level Security is enabled on all tables; users can only mutate their own rows.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Koala or later
- JDK 11+
- A Supabase project (free tier is fine)
- A Google AI Studio API key for Gemini (optional — the app falls back to mocks)

### Configuration

Create `local.properties` in the project root (this file is gitignored):



These values are injected into `BuildConfig` at build time via `app/build.gradle.kts` and surfaced through `util/Constants.java`.


## Build & Test

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug         # Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleRelease       # Build release APK
./gradlew lint                  # Lint checks
./gradlew test                  # Local JVM unit tests (Trie, PriorityQueue, Recommendation)
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest  # Instrumented tests (device/emulator required)
```

---

## Next Steps

The current build is feature-complete for the course deliverable. To take FoodTok from a course project to a deployable consumer product, the following work is queued:

### 1. Move Gemini behind a Supabase Edge Function
The Gemini API key is currently bundled into `BuildConfig` for development. For production, requests should be proxied through a Supabase Edge Function (e.g. `/functions/v1/gemini-chat`) so the key lives server-side and requests can be rate-limited per authenticated user via the Supabase JWT. This removes any risk of key extraction from the APK and lets us rotate credentials without shipping a new build.

### 2. Upgrade Gemini API to a paid tier
The free tier's 15 RPM / 1,500 RPD ceiling is shared across the whole Google account and will not survive a public launch — a single user stress-testing the chat can exhaust the daily quota. Moving to a paid tier (or Vertex AI with committed throughput) gives per-project quotas, higher RPM, and SLAs suitable for a production feed. This pairs naturally with the Edge Function above, which becomes the single billed caller.

### 3. Haptic + zoom preview animation
Add a press-and-hold gesture on feed cards that triggers a scale-up preview of the video with synchronized haptic feedback (a short tick on press, a heavier tick on release). This matches the tactile feel of modern short-video apps and gives users a low-commitment way to peek at a recipe without committing a full swipe. Implementation will use `Vibrator.vibrate(VibrationEffect)` with predefined effects and a `ScaleAnimation` or `View.animate().scaleX/Y()` pipeline tied to `MotionEvent` state.

### 4. Deploy the Edge Function and marketing site via Vercel
Stand up a Vercel project for (a) the public marketing / landing page with APK download links and (b) any companion web endpoints that don't fit Supabase Edge Functions (OAuth callbacks, webhook receivers, admin dashboards). Vercel's zero-config deploy from `main` and preview deploys per pull request give the team a fast iteration loop for the consumer-facing web surface while Supabase continues to own the application backend.

### Additional polish before public launch
- Feed pagination via PostgREST `Range` headers instead of whole-table fetch
- Local Room cache for offline read of recent feed + saved recipes
- Crashlytics + analytics (Firebase or PostHog) for real-world telemetry
- Play Store asset kit: screenshots, store listing copy, privacy policy, data-safety form
- End-to-end Espresso smoke tests covering login → feed → like → comment → save
